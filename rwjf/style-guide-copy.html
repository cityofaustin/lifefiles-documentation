        <h1 class="heading-9">MyPass Blockchain Research</h1>
        <p>The <a href="http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/mypass-digital-identity/about/overview/">MyPass</a> team has been investigating potential applications of blockchain technology in the following problem space: people experiencing homelessness must verify aspects of their identity through the exchange of physical documents. How might we replace those physical documents with secure digital copies, stored in an accessible web-based application, which prevented theft and damage, and made service transactions more efficient?<br>‍<br>As we formed our initial lines of inquiry, we were told many things about the potential of blockchain and its capabilities. Our first step was to validate these claims by testing hypotheses specific to our use case to understand what blockchain could do (for us), and what it couldn’t. This report details those tests and investigations, and explains how our work pivoted as a result of our learnings. <br></p>
        <h3>The report is broken into four sections which relate to the blockchain pivots we made as the project progressed: </h3>
        <ul role="list">

            <p>Using smart contracts to transact identification<br></p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><span class="text-span-17">Where we started: : Using smart contracts to transact identification</span></h3>
        <p>When we started the project, we were enthusiastic about blockchain’s potential to protect an individual&#x27;s privacy, and give them ultimate control over their identity documents. We weren’t the only ones who were excited about this. There are numerous industry and technology groups who are exploring the concept of self-sovereign identity and some of the tools enabled by blockchain. <br>Most of the self sovereign identity tools and approaches share a common theme: that an interaction between parties doesn’t rely on one party trusting the other one. Instead, it only relies on a pre-agreed upon transaction, in which proof occurs mathematically through cryptographic techniques.  Self sovereign identity tools are varied, and one we explored in detail was Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP provided a concentrated vehicle to investigate  all the trustless claims that we were hoping to achieve using blockchain for identity transactions.<br>‍<br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero Knowledge Proof</a> is an authentication method that requires no password exchanges. In essence, it allows a party to prove to a second party that they know some secret without actually revealing the secret. The term “zero knowledge” comes from the fact that zero information about the secret is revealed, but the second party can be convinced that the first party knows the secret in question. With blockchain, math is used to confer the validity of the secret cryptographically so as not to disclose the secret itself.Our hypothesis was that individuals can perform ID transactions through the exchange of data using ZKP, rather than the exchange of ID documents. To explore this, it is important to define what an ID transaction is. In its simplest form, an ID transaction is when a person needs to verify an aspect of their identity with another party, and some artifact is required to verify the truth of the identity. For example, an insurance card is used in the identity transaction with a medical provider to verify that the individual possesses insurance. These transactions are not always between people, sometimes they are between systems. <br>‍<br>What we found was that although ZKP identity transactions can work in theory, it would require an infrastructure of acceptance that doesn’t yet exist. Key legislation, infrastructure, and policy hurdles need to be overcome to make ZKP identity transactions viable.<br>‍<br><strong>Legislation Hurdles<br>‍</strong>Legal barriers are the first on the list. In all of the ID transactions where the government is party to the transaction, prescriptions for the types and forms of documents allowed to verify an aspect of one’s identity are governed by specific legislation which either defines the transaction, or the liability for the transaction. <br>Early in the project our team met with a manager at the City of Austin’s Office of Vital Records. We wanted to learn what would block the Office from a signed digital copy of birth certificate to a requester. We learned that the barriers were not technical, as all birth certificate records exist in digital form already. Instead, the hurdles were legal. In Texas there is a state statute which dictates that all actions of vital records, including transmitting birth certificates, are valid only if the record being transmitted is printed on a specific piece of paper from a specific manufacturer with a specific part number. Thus, any attempts to transmit records digitally are invalid (and illegal) in the eyes of Texas law.<br>The manager we spoke with stated that both she and her staff would be happy with a new system that allowed them to send a signed digital birth certificate, but that their office was powerless to enact any process changes without first getting changes in the legislation.<br>‍<br>Similar types of format and process legislation govern most ID transactions. Because ZKP-type transactions would by definition differ significantly from what is currently on the books, major changes to the law will need to occur for this method to be viable.<br>‍<br><strong>Infrastructure Hurdles<br>‍</strong>In order to accept ZKP as a valid form of ID transaction, massive infrastructure changes are required. Every point in today&#x27;s physical process (where a person evaluates an identifying document) would need to be replaced by digital means of transmitting data, computing cryptographic proofs, and outputting acceptance. If a copy of a document has to be stored for compliance, then the entire compliance system needs to be updated to accept and compute zero knowledge proofs. Rather than make a claim about how large this barrier is, it is important to point out how interconnected the system is, and that converting to ZKP would require a complete path of infrastructure changes.<br>‍<br><strong>Policy Hurdles<br>‍</strong>Not all ID digital transactions have a legislative barrier, but they do all have a policy barrier. Once any legislative and infrastructure challenges have been met, the last step is to change the bureaucratic policies which affect how people do their jobs. Depending on the size of the bureaucracy and the organizational efficiently, implementing policy changes that enable process shifts can take time. <br>‍<br><strong>Conclusion<br>‍</strong>It is our belief that ZKP are conceptually feasible for ID transactions. ZKP meets the requirements of transactions which are discussed in section 3. However, it is also accurate to say that ZKP solutions are not feasible today, and thus not appropriate for our use case. The time required for ZKP in ID transactions to become viable will depend on how long it takes for each ID system to clear the legislative, infrastructure, and policy hurdles.<br>

        <h3>Pivot 1: Understanding the security of blockchain</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-3"> If we couldn’t yet use tools like ZKP to transact identity through data, then we hypothesized that we could execute the transactions using digital versions of ID documents, and we would secure those documents with blockchain.<br>‍<br>This pivot was intended to help enable future data transactions while fulfilling our current use case. We were not abandoning the potential of secure data transactions using methods like ZKP. Rather, we thought that If we provide a secure way to store and share digital documents, then someone in the future could use those digital documents to verify the data stored on them, which would make secure data ID transactions more feasible once the infrastructure existed for their acceptance.<br>‍<br>Our hypothesis was simple: data can be secured with blockchain. This is a common claim of blockchain technology, that it is secure because it is immutable. After exploration and testing, we found that this was not the case. Blockchain itself doesn’t inherently increase security; just because something can’t be erased doesn’t mean it can’t be stolen or compromised. Standard security measures must still be used to secure data, regardless of whether blockchain technologies are in place..<br>It is helpful to consider security in the context of attack vectors. Saying “the data is secure because we use blockchain” does not consider attack vectors, and in fact is a somewhat meaningless statement (which we heard a lot). Insead, saying “our file storage architecture has three attack vectors, and we have compensated for all three” is much more meaningful, and it invites a deeper understanding into your security. <br>‍<br>Blockchain is a concatenation of data blocks which are linked together, and that utilize cryptographic techniques to ensure that a block’s content is mathematically linked to the content of past blocks. In doing so, the hashing of new blocks has the effect of securing data integrity of the past blocks. For example, if a transaction were recorded on a blockchain where I declared the color of my car was red, each successive block is computed based on the data that my car is red. If someone were to edit the first block to say my car is blue, the math from which all the subsequent blocks were constructed would break. Even if someone were to recompute all the hashes of subsequent blocks to now support my car being blue, the resulting chain would not match other existing copies of the blockchain distributed through machines across the world. Such a mismatch between copies of chains is referred to as lack of consensus.<br>‍<br>When blockchain technologists talk about data on a blockchain being secure, they mean that it is immutable, that the data can’t be changed without anyone noticing. In contrast with a database, this is a novel feature. In a database, a data value can be changed by an administrator (or someone posing as the administrator), and there is no way to know that the data changed. Although there are many types of logging and data auditing techniques that can be used, these are programmatic fixes that rely on the benevolence of the administrator to turn on. Conversely, the immutability of a blockchain comes from its cryptographic nature, i.e. it is inherent in its core design and does not specifically require trust in benevolent operators. <br>‍<br>When non technical users of technology hear about security, they rarely think about immutability and instead are thinking in terms of access control (who has access to my data and assets?). This is why we should talk about security in terms of attack vectors. In a traditional database, the data can be encrypted and the database can limit access to that encrypted data. This is referred to as a narrow attack surface. The window of time and opportunity in which someone has to break the encrypted data is small. In the case of a blockchain, the data itself can be encrypted, but the attack surface is wide, because identical copies of the blockchain are numerous and must always be accessible. Someone effectively has eternity to apply encryption cracking techniques to the data on a blockchain. In the very worst case, things put on the blockchain are written in plain language, and can be seen by everyone with no effort at all, forever. So while security around data immutability on a blockchain is very good, security around accessing data on a blockchain is very bad.<br>‍<br><strong>Considering the above, personal data should not be stored on a blockchain.</strong> Even though it is possible to store any data (including images of documents) on blockchains, and it is also possible to encrypt that data so it is difficult to read, the data is viewable for all of time in what is effectively an unsecured database, which creates a privacy hazard. In addition, most industry groups believe that placing personally-identifiable information on blockchains violates the right to be forgotten contained in laws such as GDPR. <strong><br>‍<br>Conclusion</strong><br>Data security is achieved by using encrypted data in a secured database. In such cases, auditability comes from hashing the database log and periodically anchoring that hash to an immutable ledger such as blockchain. Thus, blockchain plays a part in data security, but it alone does not make data, especially personally-identifiable information, secure. Not providing that type of detail and simply claiming that “blockchain is secure” has led to much confusion in the non-technical community about data security conferred by blockchain. We hope this explanation helps bring clarity to this topic.<br></p>
        <h3>Pivot 2: Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</h3>
        <p><strong>A quick primer on Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</strong><br>To understand our next pivot, it is helpful to have some background information on Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.<br>One of the fundamental building blocks of decentralized technology is a web3.0 interoperability data standard called a DID, or Decentralized identifier. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C specification</a>:<br>‍<br>“<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers"> DID</a> to prove control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.”<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers"> </a><br>DIDs operate as a pointer, much like a URL which connects documents to the people or entities the documents relate to. The definition space for DIDs is growing, but currently there are two important properties of DIDs that should be pointed out: <br>‍<br><strong>DIDs are Interoperable</strong> <br>The real benefit that comes with using DIDs is that their URLs can be written to any number of decentralized ledgers, and due to their common data format, they promise interoperability from one decentralized ledger to another. As an example, this means that a URL on the ethereum ledger can reference a URL on the bitcoin ledger and vice versa. <br>‍<br><strong>DIDs can be used to cont</strong>
          <a href="#"><strong>r</strong></a><strong>ol documents<br>‍</strong>By itself, a new data format is not revolutionary.But what is exciting about DIDs is the community of practice that is building tools and processes around DIDs to enable decentralized identity. One of the mechanisms that is emerging in the DID space is the ability for people to control documents about themselves instead of being beholden to a centralized controller for this. <br>‍<br>This works by allowing whoever signed the DID to have control over its content and revocation. In theory, If the DID points to a document via URL, then the one with control over the DID has the authority to control access and use of that document. In practice, this requires a larger ecosystem of participants and software drivers in order to extend the actual control to individuals. <br><br><strong>Verifiable credentials</strong><br>Within the web3.0 list of DID data formats, there is one referred to as a Verifiable Credential (VC). This is just a piece of data that has been formatted to a specific schema and signed by a trustworthy source. The intent of Verifiable Credentials is to confer the virtue of the signer to the validity of the thing being signed. This can be applied to documents (the document is authentic), or credentials (Dr. Smith is actually a doctor).<br>As with other DID formats, there are different methods for creating, storing, and presenting VCs. Although it does not apply to all VC transactions, one important feature is that <strong>a VC can be registered to a blockchain in order to create an immutable timestamp. <br>‍</strong><br>Many folks within the identity space see VC infrastructure as the future of identification. If much of our online identity is reputation based, then VCs represent a formal method for linking reputations and vouching for others to form a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/rebranding-web-of-trust.pdf">web of trust</a> within which individuals are able to conduct identity transactions in a less centralized way. <br>‍<br><strong>Verified digital document authenticity </strong><br>We now know that blockchain alone could not provide the security we needed to secure personal documents, but we also re-confirmed that we could secure documents using standard information security practices, and that VCs could allow users to transact with digital documents in the place of physical originals.<br>‍<br>This led to our next hypothesis: a VC can be used to validate that a digital scan of a document came from the authentic document, and therefore a receiving entity can accept it as valid. <br>‍<br>While this is true in theory, much like our investigation of ZKP, we found that there are currently neither trustworthy signers willing to operate within such a system, nor verifiers willing to accept the system. After examining a multitude of identification transactions in the homelessness space, we realized that no matter what the specific transaction entailed, there are three fundamental properties required, and these properties look different depending on the transaction. <br>‍<br><strong>Property 1: Document authenticity<br></strong>Ensuring a document is authentic and hasn’t been changed is the first building block of an ID transaction. Examples like tamper resistant IDs and counterproof resistant currency are the physical analog. We don&#x27;t accept photocopied currency regardless of who vouches for it because it lacks this authenticity property. Today, VCs have this property in digital form. The VCl data format supports public private keys, which can be used to verify the authenticity of the document. Thus, the document authenticity property supports our hypothesis that VCs can be used to validate digital documents. <br>‍<br><strong>Property 2: Proof of authority<br>‍</strong>In a transaction, just being a trustworthy validator of the information is not enough; the issuer needs the authority to vouch for the information. For example: the state’s authority to issue a driver&#x27;s license forces the acceptance of a driver&#x27;s license by the police officer who pulls someone over for speeding. Conversely, because the state’s authority does not extend into the academic realm, a diploma issued by the department of motor vehicles would not be accepted by an employer, even though the DMV is trustworthy. Right now, this proof of authority property does not exist for VCs. In other words, even if a highly trustworthy police officer issues a VC, all that is conferred to the credital is the reputation of the officer and not his legal standing. Proof of authority for VCs requires legislation changes for credentials backed by government authorities, and it requires large-scale adoption (and support) for credentials backed by industry or communities of practice. This is where our hypothesis began to break down.<br>‍<br><strong>Property 3: Chain of liability<br>‍</strong>Similar to proof of authority, liability for the information (i.e. who is accountable if a document’s information is incorrect), is an acceptance criteria that must be met for each ID transaction. <br>‍<br>In many cases, the parties in an ID transaction are liable in the event that the ID documents are false. As an example, if a fake ID is used to purchase alcohol, the two individuals in the transaction are the minor, and the bartender. If the fraudulent ID is discovered, the minor can be liable for identity fraud. If the fraudulent id is not discovered, then the bartender is liable for serving a minor. In this scenario, a web-of-trust transaction would not work well as the bar next door, having already accepted the fraudulent ID, does not remove the liability from the current bartender to check the ID for themselves.<br>‍<br>An example of an interaction where the participating parties do not hold liability is a credit card transaction. In this case, the vendor need not verify that the credit card is authentic, only that the credit company will vouch for the payment. This is a scenario where the web-of-trust would work great. <br>‍<br>It would seem that where liability falls to the parties participating in the transaction, evidence of validity needs to be present at the transaction. In the case of our bartender above, the use of a tamper resistant photo ID, and a photo that matches the individual, are the components of evidence necessary to accept the liability. <br>‍<br><strong>Conclusion<br>‍</strong>VC infrastructure will work for only some ID transactions because the infrastructure does not currently address all three requirements for ID transactions: proof of authority, chain of liability, and document authenticity. In order for VCs to be accepted in ID transactions, legislation is needed to clarify the proof of authority and chain of liability for VCs.<br><br>Pivot 3: NotarizationsIf the concept of a Verifiable Credential sounds familiar, that’s because it borrows much of its utility from notarizations. The recognition of this similarity led us to research digital notaries and our next discovery: e-notarizations<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Pivot 3: Notarizations</h3>
        <p>If the concept of a Verifiable Credential sounds familiar, that’s because it borrows much of its utility from notarizations. The recognition of this similarity led us to research digital notaries and our next discovery: e-notarizations<br>‍<br>First, we found the laws which govern electronic records in the state of Texas, specifically chapter 322 of the Business and Commerce Code: <br>‍<a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/GV/htm/GV.406.htm">https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/GV/htm/GV.406.htm</a>
          <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.322.htm">https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.322.htm</a>This statute says a few really important things:<strong>Electronic contracts cannot be denied effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form </strong>Sec. 322.007<strong>Electronic Notarizations are a valid form of digital contract as long as a digital signature is used. </strong>Sec. 322.011<strong>Electronic Records are transferable sec 322.016 if: There is a way to identify a single digital original from any copy of the electronic record. The owner has control over the document <br>‍</strong><br>In short, it may be possible to provide people with legally executable digital documents as long as we meet the rules of the statute. This could look like a registered Texas notary making a digital certified copy of a document, and signing that document with a digital signature. According to Texas law, such a document would be legally acceptable as the original document. <br>‍<br>Furthermore if the methods were applied to detect a digital original from a copy, and methods for control of a digital document could be put in place, then the document could be transferred from the notary to the owner of the document. <br>‍<br>The congruences between  the requirements of the law and the capabilities of the VC infrastructure were immediately clear to us. This discovery led us to our next pivot. We could utilize the secure signing infrastructure of VCs to create a digital notarization where the notary acts at the issuer of a VC. We could register the VC to a blockchain and create an immutable timestamp to identify the original document from copy. We could use the DID infrastructure for document control in order to achieve transferability of the certified copy from the issuing notary-the creator of the VC, to the owner of the document. <br>‍<br>Unlike VCs alone, digitally notarizatrized VCs appear to meet all the criteria for ID transactions. Document authenticity is achieved using cryptographic signatures.  Proof of authority is specifically afforded to this package through laws governing e notarization.Chain of liability is solved because a bond exists for each notary to cover the liability associated from not having evidence at the point of transaction.  If the transaction is fraudulent, the financial damages are covered by the notaries bond.<br>‍<br><strong>Conclusion<br>‍</strong>We believe that It is possible to support ID transactions using digital documents, in place of physical original documents, if those digitals documents are digitally notarized according to  existing laws pertaining to notarizations and implemented using VC infrastructure. Blockchain (by virtue of an immutable timestamp), and VCs (by virtue of their signing infrastructure) can allow digital notarizations to maintain legal executability while being transferred from one party to another. <br>
